                <span class="first-letter">M</span>onths earlier, she went through the same way.
The heaviness in her head had been worse then—thick, unmistakable. She went to the ER, the process unfolded efficiently and without drama. Super long waiting, Blood tests. etc. The nurses were kind, practiced. Everything came back normal. No signs of poisoning. No neurological event. Stress, they suggested. Exhaustion. Hormonal fluctuation. One doctor asked gently whether she’d been sleeping enough.
She nodded. It was easier than explaining the rest.
She went home with paperwork and instructions to return if symptoms worsened. They didn’t worsen. They dissolved, slowly, until the memory of them began to feel exaggerated, almost theatrical. Within days, she told herself it had been nothing. Within weeks, she stopped thinking about it altogether.
Until now.
            </p>
            <p>
The memory surfaced later that evening, uninvited, while she sat at the edge of consciousness, her body heavy and unresponsive, the air still moving steadily from the vent.
Other memories followed, less urgent at first.
</p>
<p>
Her older daughter’s birthday. The first one after the separation.
Ryane had insisted on celebrating together, framing it as something done for the child rather than for himself. He invited a couple he knew—Paul and Nancy—who lived in the basement suite of the house at the time. Paul had worked with Ryane briefly, long enough to share stories, long enough to develop the loose familiarity that came from overlapping social circles and mutual acquaintances. People to gossip with. People whose names recurred.
The dinner had been awkward but civil. Cake. Small talk. The careful choreography of separated adults pretending to agree on things.
At some point, after the children drifted away from the table, Paul began talking about his work. The company was having problems, he said. Big ones. The partners were in conflict, deeply divided. One of them had moved out. Another had stopped answering calls. The separation was ugly, fueled by arguments that had gone on too long.
Nancy listened without reacting, her hand resting on her glass.
Paul went on. One of the company’s trucks had gone missing a few days earlier. Vanished overnight. They’d reported it to the police, of course. Standard procedure. The truck turned up eventually, abandoned, intact. Nothing taken. No explanation offered.
“The police didn’t really do anything,” Paul said, shrugging. “If you can’t find the evidence yourself, they won’t help you find it.”
He sighed as if this were a general truth, not a complaint.
Ryane nodded. Slowly. In agreement. “That’s how it is,” he said. “You have to know what you’re looking for.”
She remembered watching them then, the ease with which they aligned, the way the conversation settled comfortably into shared cynicism. She hadn’t thought much of it at the time. It was the kind of talk men fell into, she told herself—systems failing, authorities useless, responsibility shifting quietly away from institutions and back onto individuals.
Now, lying motionless as the furnace continued to blow, the memory felt different.
Sharper.
</p>
<p>
The faint fragrance lingered in the air, steady and even. The camera’s presence—though unseen by her—had already changed the room. And somewhere between wakefulness and sleep, a thought tried to surface, incomplete but insistent:
This had happened before.
