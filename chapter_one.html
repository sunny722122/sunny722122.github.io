The curtain was open, the morning pale and unfiltered, spreading evenly across the walls and the foot of the bed. For a moment she stayed still, letting her eyes adjust. Her head felt heavy—not aching, not dizzy, just weighted, as if it took a second longer than usual for thoughts to surface.

Her younger daughter slept beside her, turned toward the wall, one arm tucked beneath the pillow. They shared the bed now, a king-sized one that felt too large at night and oddly cramped in the morning. She shifted carefully, mindful of the child’s breathing, and felt the familiar pressure of the shorts against her waist and thighs.

She had chosen them on purpose the night before. They were never loose. She liked that about them—the way they held her, the certainty of their fit. Tight, but predictable. This morning, though, something felt wrong.

She slid her hand down and touched the zipper. It wasn’t centered. It leaned slightly to one side—not open, not broken, just slanted. She tried to straighten it with two fingers, but the fabric resisted, pulling the angle back into place. The shorts themselves fit exactly as they always had. It was the zipper that unsettled her, the small refusal to align.

She sat up slowly. The heaviness in her head shifted but didn’t lift.
              <p>

The room was simple. An embedded wardrobe lined one wall, its doors closed. A low dresser stood close to the end of the bed, leaving only a narrow gap. On her side, a small metal file cabinet served as a nightstand. Her laptop rested on top, lid closed. Beside it, a small camera sat upright, its indicator light on. She noticed this immediately and looked away.

On the other side of the bed, a plastic nightstand held a tissue box and a cup with a few pens. Above the door, the metal bolt caught the light. The door was locked. The washroom door stood half open, the mirror inside already reflecting the morning.

She stood and moved quietly to the window. Outside, the street was beginning to stir—early walkers, a passing car. She turned her body sideways and lowered herself into a half squat beside the bed, positioning herself carefully in front of the window but below its line of sight. Her movements were practiced, economical.

She changed quickly. The pajama top came off first, then the shorts, folded and placed on the edge of the bed. She pulled on a blouse, buttoning it without looking, then stepped into long black pants, smoothing the fabric at the hips. The zipper closed straight this time. She did not pause to consider that.

She stood, glanced once at the sleeping child, then crossed to the nightstand. She picked up her computer and slipped her phone into her pocket. The camera remained where it was, still on, its small light steady.

She moved to the door, unlocked it, and lifted the bolt as quietly as possible. Before opening it, she paused—not listening for sound, but waiting for something inside herself to settle. It didn’t.

She slipped out of the room and closed the door behind her, leaving the light, the bed, and the morning exactly as they were.
            </p>
            <img src="chapter-one.png" alt="Chapter illustration" class="chapter-image">
            <p>
                When she stepped out of the bedroom, the day did not begin so much as resume—like a paused recording clicking back into motion.

She washed her face quickly, avoiding her own reflection. Then she moved to the desk.

It was a tall wooden structure she had built herself, rough at the edges, measured precisely to her standing height. From here she could work without sitting, without relaxing. The desk faced the large fixed window of the living room, its glass unmoving, its view always watching back. Morning light spilled in, indifferent and exposed.

The wide monitor glowed faintly. Her laptop rested on a raised metal frame, angled upward like a second pair of eyes. Behind the screen sat the old inkjet printer she had bought years ago—secondhand, slightly yellowed, unreliable but persistent. Like many things she kept.

At seven o’clock, her phone alarm rang.
            </p>
            <p>
The sound sliced cleanly through her thoughts.
                </p>
            <p>

She went to her eldest daughter’s door and knocked, softly but firmly. While waiting for a response, her gaze drifted back toward the laptop screen, as if something might shift the moment she looked away.

Nothing did.
                </p>
            <p>

At seven-thirty, she called for the younger one. Breakfast passed in fragments—unfinished toast, half-swallowed words, small hands moving too slowly for the time she no longer had. She drove them to school, smiled when required, nodded when expected.

All the while, her mind circled a single image.
                </p>
            <p>

The slanted zipper.
                </p>
<p>
It surfaced again and again, sharp and unmistakable, refusing to fade.
</p>
            <p>

It’s not the first time, she told herself.
Then why does it feel different today?
                </p>
<p>
The question followed her home.
            </p>
<p>
She sat at her desk, hands hovering above the keyboard, unable to begin. Doubt pressed in from all sides—what if she was wrong, what if she was imagining it, what if speaking it aloud made her ridiculous.

Yet beneath the doubt was something heavier.
</p>
            <p>
A knowing.
</p>
            <p>
After long minutes of stillness, she made her decision.
                </p>

She typed a request for urgent leave. The words looked unreal on the screen, as if written by someone else. Then she grabbed her phone, her keys, and drove to the hospital without allowing herself time to reconsider.

In the emergency department, she did not speak.
            <p>

Instead, she typed her concern into her phone and handed it to the triage nurse. Watching the woman read it, her chest tightened. She stared at the floor, heat rising to her face. Shame crawled through her—not because she believed she was wrong, but because saying it made it real.

Waiting followed.
                </p>
            <p>

A long, hollow waiting that stretched her nerves thin.
            

When she finally saw the doctor, she spoke carefully, cautiously, building each sentence as if it might collapse under its own weight. She described what she suspected. She asked for a forensic examination.

The word forensic echoed in her head long after she said it.

Afterward, the doctor introduced her to a detective. He was calm, professional, and almost gentle. Their conversation was brief—too brief for the storm gathering inside her.

</p>
            <p>
                Time, again, betrayed her.
    </p>

It was nearly time to pick up her daughter.

She scheduled another meeting and left the hospital quickly, as though staying longer might pull her under. In the car, her hands trembled against the steering wheel.

Somewhere deep inside, she hoped the examination would uncover something—proof, damage, anything that would confirm she was not losing her grip on reality.

She hoped the detective would find the same.

When she saw her daughter, she forced herself to smile.

Her voice sounded normal. Her questions were ordinary. She acted as though the day had unfolded exactly as every other day had. She stayed close to her younger daughter, closer than usual, her hand brushing the child’s shoulder again and again without realizing it.

They went home together.

The older daughter had already returned. The house absorbed them quietly, swallowing the tension without comment.

Dinner. Plates. Routine.

At eight o’clock, she smiled into the camera during the video call with her parents, nodding at familiar words, laughing when expected. At nine, the children went to bed.

Only then did silence return.

She stayed awake after her younger daughter fell asleep, sitting at the desk in the dim room. For one or two hours, she studied—though later she would not remember what she had read.

At last, she turned off the light.

She switched on the small camera positioned on the file cabinet that served as a nightstand in the corner of the room. The faint indicator light blinked alive. Watching. Recording.

She checked the door lock.

Then the bolt.

Then checked them again.

Only after that did she lie down.

In the darkness, her body rested—but her mind did not.

She listened.

And waited.
